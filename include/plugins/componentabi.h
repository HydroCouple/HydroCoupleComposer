 * \brief  The convention by which a shared library publishes a HydroCouple
 *         component, and the ABI stamp that makes loading it safe.
 *
 * HydroCouple v2 components are plain C++ objects — there is no QObject and
 * therefore no Qt plugin system to lean on, and the SDK deliberately ships no
 * loader (`ModelInitializer` takes a caller-supplied resolver). A host that
 * wants to load components from disk must define the contract itself; this
 * header is that contract, kept free of Qt and of Composer types so it can be
 * upstreamed into the SDK unchanged.
 *
 * A component library exports exactly two C functions:
 *
 *   const char          *hydrocouple_component_abi_v1(void);
 *   HydroCouple::IComponentInfo *hydrocouple_component_info_v1(void);
 *
 * `HYDROCOUPLE_DECLARE_COMPONENT(InfoType)` emits both.
 *
 * \par Why an ABI stamp
 * Passing C++ objects across a shared-library boundary is only defined when
 * both sides were built with the same toolchain and standard library. There
 * is no portable way to *recover* from a mismatch once a mismatched C++
 * function has been called, so the mismatch has to be detected before that
 * happens. `hydrocouple_component_abi_v1` is pure C returning a string, which
 * is safe to call across any mismatch; the host compares it against its own
 * `HYDROCOUPLE_COMPONENT_ABI_STAMP` and refuses the library on disagreement.
 * The stamp is therefore the *only* symbol that may be called before the
 * check succeeds.
 *
 * \par Ownership
 * The `IComponentInfo` returned by `hydrocouple_component_info_v1` is owned by
 * the library (a function-local static) and must not be deleted by the host;
 * it stays valid until the library is unloaded. Component *instances* created
 * through `IModelComponentInfo::createComponentInstance()` are owned by the
 * host, and — as a direct consequence — must be destroyed before the library
 * that allocated them is unloaded.

 * HydroCouple's Python bindings (`hydrocouple.loader.load`) already load
 * components through an `extern "C"` factory named `CreateComponentInfo`

 * against that convention predate this header, and refusing them would split
 * the component ecosystem in two — Python-loadable versus Composer-loadable.
 *
 * Composer therefore accepts both: the stamped entry points when present, and
 * this legacy factory otherwise. Legacy libraries are loaded on a best-effort
 * basis and reported as unstamped, because there is genuinely no way to
 * verify their toolchain before calling into them.
